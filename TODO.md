# TODO for the atria package:
* add Roxygen documentation to all functions in the package
* add benchmarking tools for comparison with other packages
* explore optimization of the atria algorithm:
   - parameter tuning
   - spill-over trees
   - SIMD distance caluclation(!)
   - allowing to build search trees with wrong (lower) Rmax
   - store Rmax and Rmedian, use Rmedian for approximate searches
   - compute cluster centroids to reduce Rmax
